**Biography:** My name is Sacha Schlegel born in 1971 in Switzerland,
grown up in the Principality of Liechtenstein (in the heart of Europe).
After obligatory school I finished a commercial apprenticeship in a Bank
in Liechtenstein. Studied Computer Science (CS) and Business in
Switzerland afterwards. Came to Australia in 2001 for a postgraduate
diploma in CS and a masters by research in CS. My hobbies are Soccer,
Windsurfing, Linux and lately (9 months) my little daughter Tawha.

**Slides:** Slides from this talk [can be viewed on-line](slides.pdf).
