User-Mode Linux is a project that is maturing quickly and has become
fairly stable for everyday general use. This talk will go over the
basics of User-Mode Linux, what it is, how to run it and more.  "More"
will probably include the use of User-Mode Linux for another interest
of Trent's, i.e. IPV6.
