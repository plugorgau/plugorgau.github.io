Creating forms for the maintenance of a MySQL database, using the GUI
elements available in OpenOffice.org 1.0.3. No code will be harmed in

<!-- **Where:** Central TAFE Lecture Theatre, Perth -->

**Biography:** Born in Perth, way too long ago. Worked in the Kimberley,
mainly mining and mechanic-ing, then came back to Perth. Spent two years
at TAFE studying IT, database programming, latest toys and walks on the
beach. Discovered Linux about four years back and have struggled with it
ever since. Every time I think I understand something, something else
attracts my attention and I am back to square one, learning all over
again. Short philosophical note; "Users should not have to learn about
computers, software should do the knowing, users do the work. Your
average mechanic cannot mine and refine metal, create an alloy then
forge a good spanner, he just turns the thing. Computers should do the
same."
