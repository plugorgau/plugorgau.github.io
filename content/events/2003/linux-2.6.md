The 2.5 series kernel is approaching stability and should be ready to
be released as 2.6.0 within the next 12 months. Tony will show some of
the new features in the current development kernels.  Touching on user
concerns, passing thought new features for system administrators, and
stopping at some of the nifty things that have happened that you
*shouldn't* ever see :)

**Biography:** Tony started using Linux in 1995 (shortly after he
arrived in Perth). In 1996 he erased any other OS from his machine
(something that survived until he got his notebook). In 1998 he found
PLUG and kind'a just stayed hanging around.
