Small single board computers like the Raspberry Pi provide a great
base for deploying projects. However, designing a system so it can be
updated after deployment can be a challenge. When devices are hooked
up to the Internet, this becomes even more critical due to the regular
stream of security vulnerabilities that may impact the install.

Ubuntu Core can help here by providing a streamlined Linux
distribution that supports transactional automatic updates for both
the base operating system and for applications built on top of it.

This talk will explore how to build applications that can run on
Ubuntu Core, and how to generate disk images containing Ubuntu Core
plus your application ready to deploy to a device or virtual machine.
