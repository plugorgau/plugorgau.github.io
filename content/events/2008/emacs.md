Emacs has a very long history of being one of the most full-featured
text editors around. Not only that, but it has a whole galaxy of other
features: everything from a Tetris clone to a Usenet news reader. It
also goes hand-in-hand with Unix's tradition of supporting the
programming process.

This introductory talk assumes no prior Emacs experience.<!--more-->
It will cover the following areas:-

-   helpful mindsets for using Emacs
-   highly-efficient text editing in Emacs
-   The use of Emacs as an IDE
-   the philosophy behind Emacs' construction

Traditionally Emacs was terminal-based, but now there are two main
"competing" branches from the original code, each offering different
GUIs: [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and
[XEmacs](https://www.xemacs.org/).  They have other differences too,
including architectural and API aspects.

That's right -- the plot thickens -- Emacs has an API. The
*majority* of Emacs is actually written in LISP. This allows bits of
Emacs to be easily overridden or extended. It also makes it relatively
easy to add completely new features and editing modes.

From a non-programmer's perspective, Emacs is also highly customisable,
offering a very powerful menu-driven configuration interface. It really
is the ultimate kitchen sink editor.
