In this presentation I hope to explain some of the fundamentals of LDAP,
how it works and what if can be useful for. I will demonstrate setting
up and LDAP server for a network, how to manage accounts within a LDAP
directory and setting up client machines to authenticate against the
LDAP server. With these basics, it is possible to have unified usernames
and passwords across your whole network, including Linux login, email,
web and Samba. And as a special treat (assuming all goes well over the
weekend), I'll demonstrate my shiny new OpenSolaris server with ZFS and
VirtualBox.
