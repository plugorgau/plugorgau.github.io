Patrick will be talking about iSCSI - a protocol for exporting storage
devices over a standard ethernet network. iSCSI is gaining popularity as
a cheap alternative to Fibre Channel for connecting storage area
networks (SANs). The talk will discuss the principals of iSCSI, along
with the pros and cons, and will include some experiences deploying
iSCSI in a high-availability environment with (hopfully) a demo.

Following the seminar, we will hold the PLUG 2008 AGM.

School, alongside running a web services company. He is currently the
