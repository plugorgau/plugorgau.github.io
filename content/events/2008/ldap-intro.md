LDAP is the standard protocol for storing and accessing identity
information. OpenLDAP is a high-performance, hugely scalable
implementation of this important standard that you can install on your
(Linux based) server or laptop in about 3 minutes. Whether you need to
provide access control for a large organisation or store the contact
details for a couple of million close, personal friends, OpenLDAP can
help.

In this introductory talk, Ritchie will show you how to configure
OpenLDAP on Linux and talk about where it fits with other identity
management technologies.
