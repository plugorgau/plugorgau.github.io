With a computer on every desktop, we sometimes forget that most modern
operating systems are designed for more than one user. This talk will
take you through the things you need to keep in mind as a user of the
most popular multiple-user systems - shared web hosting, and shell
servers - such as the UNIX security model, keeping database credentials
secure, and the dangers posed by web-administered CMSes.

The principles discussed in this talk are aimed at novice and
intermediate Linux users, including those who use Windows on their
desktops but manage websites on UNIX hosts, or who use shell servers.
Additionally, some tips will be presented for people who are just
getting started with administering shared hosting.

David Adam is a volunteer systems administrator for the University
Computer Club, and pays the bills by running a Windows network. He
enjoys good beer, (very) cheap wine, and spends most of his time as a
medical student at UWA.
