This is a special post-Installfest talk, aimed at introducing newcomers
to their Linux systems. Topics to be covered include navigating the
shell, basic system administration, and protecting yourself with a
firewall. A large part of the talk will be distribution neutral, though
upon request, distribution-specific demonstrations may be done.
