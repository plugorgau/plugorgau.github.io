Have you ever wondered what it takes to write a computer game? Have you
ever wondered how object oriented languages work? Have you ever wanted
to be Horatius Cocles at the Sublician Bridge, the sole hero that
"everybody" turns to for their survival?

<!--more-->

Your every need (in these respects, at least) can be satisfied if you
trot along to this seminar at Central TAFE to hear Leon Brooks,
principle of CyberKnights, show you what went into Cruiser Tech, a
ruby-SDL game soon to appear in an Australian magazine near you.

See Open Source tools in action! See environmental responsibility at
work! Hear really bad sound effects! Add range to your definition of the
phrase "ad hoc"! Join our capable peanut gallery, and take home enough
understanding to build one of your own.

<!-- **Where:** Central TAFE Lecture Theatre, Perth -->
