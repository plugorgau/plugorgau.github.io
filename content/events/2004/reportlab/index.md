This talk will cover the use of ReportLab with Python and the database
of your choice to generate well-presented PDFs and printed reports. A
method for dynamically generating PDFs for web use, cgi-script style,
will also be covered.

<!--more-->

Basic knowledge of Python will be helpful, but not required.

<!-- **Where:** Central TAFE Lecture Theatre, Perth -->

**Slides and Extras from Craig:**

You'll probably want the [full
presentation](plug_rl_presentation.tar.bz2), including all
the examples and the source code to the presentation.

Alternately, you can download [just the
PDF](plug_rl_presentation.pdf).

**Extra software:**

For your convenience, here's a list of links to the home pages of the
software you\'re likely to need.

-   [Python](https://www.python.org/). You'll want to use at least
    Python 2.2, preferably Python 2.3.
-   You'll obviously be wanting [ReportLab](https://www.reportlab.com/).
-   [PyPgSQL](https://pypgsql.sourceforge.net/) is likely to be useful
    if you\'ll be talking to a database, though you have plenty of
    [choice](https://www.python.org/topics/database/) when it comes to
    databases and interface modules.
-   ReportLab works best with the [Python Imaging
    Library](https://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) installed.
-   [Psyco](https://psyco.sourceforge.net/) is a handy JIT compiler
    for Python.
