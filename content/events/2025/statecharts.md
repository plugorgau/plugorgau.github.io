Harry McNally will tell us about State Charts, State Machines and QP/C
in embedded systems.
<!--more-->

In embedded programming, between big loop and RealRTOS, is a
lightweight framework called QP/C which implements asynchronous,
event-driven Hierarchical State Machines described as Active Objects.

The frameworks are dual-licensed so they are available for download
and use in open-source projects.

The developer, Miro Samek, has over several decades prepared video
coursework that describe all approaches to embedded programming
including Quantum Programming; the QP/C, QP/C++, and support tools.

For anyone interested in embedded programming, the talk will discuss
how HSM statecharts can be used to define and then implement embedded
systems.

Many of the coursework examples on real low-cost evaluation boards
offer advantages in embedded development comparable to open source
software projects that "An example is a thousand instruction manuals".

The talk is for anyone interested in embedded programming and working
close to the silicon.
