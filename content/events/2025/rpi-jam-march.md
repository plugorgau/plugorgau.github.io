* Do you think Raspberry Pis are interesting, but need help getting started?
* Perhaps you want to make a low-powered media server, or retro gaming machine?
* Do you have a Raspberry Pi project that you would like to show to others?
* Bring your own laptop, Raspberry Pi (if you have one), and power supply. We will have power boards to plug into, along with a monitor.
