The process of ad-hoc system administration, in which lengthy and
possibly insecure installation commands are typed/pasted from software
project websites or even Q&A sites, is both time-consuming and not
recommended from a security perspective.

However, OS-provided software packages are often old versions or not
present at all.  And modern DevOps approaches like Ansible, Puppet,
Vagrant or Docker are not always justified, especially for
experimentation or work on one's own workstation.

Toolbelt fills the gap, by automating the recommended installation
approach described on the provider's website for each supported piece
of software.

This presentation will give an overview of Toolbelt, including a
partial code walkthrough and a description of how to extend it to
support additional software.
