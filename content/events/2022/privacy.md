This month we are going to try an experiment with the meeting format,
and hold a discussion directed by the meeting's participants. If
there's a topic you'd like to discus on the theme of privacy, or you
have questions you think the community might be able to help you
answer, this is good opportunity.

So we can keep the meeting on track, please add any topics you'd like
to discuss to this document:

required to edit). We will also use the document to make notes about
the discussion.
