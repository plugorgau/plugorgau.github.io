Join us for our annual quiz night, which this year is being held at
the [Captain Stirling Hotel in
Nedlands](https://www.captainstirlinghotel.com.au/).

You don't need to be a Linux expert - the questions will cover a wide
range of subjects, so family and friends are welcome.

The cost is $5 for members, $10 for non-members. Payment direct to our
bank account (details at plug.org.au/membership) is preferred, but we
can also accept cash on the night.

The quiz will start at 19;00, but come earlier to buy a drink, order
food and socialise.
