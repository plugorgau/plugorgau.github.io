When PLUG started holding hybrid in-person/online meetings using Big
Blue Button, we wanted a way to publish professional looking videos
from the slides, camera footage and audio. Rather than editing
everything together manually, I built some scripts to automate the
process using GStreamer Editing Services: a library for
non-destructive video editing.

This talk will cover the basics of using GES, creating a set of edits,
and rendering the resulting video. It will also demonstrate how these
projects can be worked on further using the Pitivi video editing
software.
