The 21st century is a time with an unprecedented expansion of ideas,
culture, technology, information, and global justice. Compared to any
other point in history, humans are flourishing. Yet the way in which
we think about the world—and our shared future in it—has not
accelerated at the same pace. Join us to find out why the future is
awesome in ways you may not expect, and what you can do about it.
