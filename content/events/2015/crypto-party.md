Crypto Party in conjunction with Port80 run by Luke John.
<!--more-->

There will be a few lighting talks and some discussion around things like:
* Key Signing
* Full Disk Encryption
* Metadata / Mandatory Data Retention
* Hardware Security
* Tor

Followed by breakout sessions where you can do some practical crypto.
If you want to get your PGP keys signed bring along some ID or if you
don't use PGP but want to know how, bring along a laptop and we can
get you set up.
