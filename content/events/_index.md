We use the Google calendar (below) and [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Perth-Linux-Users-Group-PLUG) to plan our events please look at those for specific events and details.

Generally, PLUG runs a talk once a month at [Spacecubed](https://www.spacecubed.com/) along with a meetup in a local pub once every two months and a quiz night with prizes once a year around April or May.
