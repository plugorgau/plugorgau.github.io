Adrian Chadd runs a web hosting business specialising in providing Xen
virtual machines. He will be talking about his experiences in doing
so, with the intention of making virtualisation seem less like black
magic.  The talk will cover various virtualisation methods and
techniques, as well as some particular implementations (VMWare, Java,
Xen, Linux KVM, jails). Or as he puts it, "Adrian will rant a bit like
he normally does, you might pick up something useful."
