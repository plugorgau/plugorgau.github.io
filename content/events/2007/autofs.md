Many large scale enterprise deployments include an automounter
implementation. The automounter provides a mechanism for automatically
mounting file systems upon access, and umounting them when they are no
longer referenced. It turns out that the Linux automounter is not
feature-complete, and there are cases where Linux is just plain
incompatible with the implementations from other proprietary vendors.

This presentation looks at the common problems in large-scale Linux
autofs deployments, and offers solutions to these problems. It is the
same presentation given about a year ago but will focus on the
development progress of the new features in autofs version 5 described
in the presentation.

#### Getting There

This month's seminar is being held in the 'Futuresphere', Christ
Church Grammar School, located at:

**Christ Church Grammar School\
Queenslea Drive\
Claremont WA\
**

To get to Queenslea Drive from the Freeway, jump off at Mounts Bay Road
then take Stirling Hwy to Claremont (about 10 minutes past UWA). Having
gone through Claremont, you\'ll see a stone church to the left; turn
immediately left at the next set of lights (Queenslea Drive), and the
school will be directly on your right.
