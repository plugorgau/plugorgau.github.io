The Lustre cluster file system provides a POSIX-compliant file system
API for clusters of almost any size.<!--more--> It's designed to scale
along all axes: given sufficient hardware, it can offer gigabytes-per-
second access to multi-petabyte storage arrays. Most of the world's
largest supercomputers use Lustre to access their storage, including
the largest clusters in North America, Europe, and Asia.

This makes Lustre relatively unique, not just by file system standards,
but also in what it requires from its operating system environment.

In this hour we'll tour the highlights of Lustre's design, including:

-   how Lustre differs from most other cluster file systems
-   locking and concurrency
-   a challenging recovery problem or two
-   Linux kernel integration and associated nightmares

Refreshments will be provided after the seminar, thanks to

#### About Phil

Phil is a visiting iVEC Industry & Government Fellow, consulting in the
areas of open source business, software engineering process, and storage
for high-performance computing.

He's been actively involved in open source and open development since
1992, contributing to a variety of technologies including enterprise
desktop, Linux, privacy and security, network file systems, and consumer
internet.

He co-founded CFS, co-developed its award-winning open-source Lustre
file system, and oversaw the company's first four profitable years as
Chief Executive. Lustre is used on most of the world\'s largest Linux
supercomputers, providing high-speed, POSIX-compliant storage for
governments, universities, and Fortune 100 companies worldwide.

At the Mozilla Corporation he directed an overhaul of localization for
Firefox 2.0, shipping the web browser simultaneously in 23 languages for
the first time. Approximately 20% of the world's internet population
uses Firefox as their primary browser, including a growing proportion in
languages other than English.

Previously, Phil executed the open-source strategy for zero-knowledge
systems, one of the most widely-discussed providers of privacy and
security software and services. He also helped develop a toolkit for
private electronic cash and one of the first commercial anonymous IP
networks.
