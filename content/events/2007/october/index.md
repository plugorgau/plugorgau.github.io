It would be painfully obvious to anyone who\'s worked with computers
that they are far from perfect. Failures are forever prevalent and often
expensive. To mitigate the affects of these failures, monitoring is
essential. Adrian Woodley will present a talk covering several
monitoring packages available to \*nix systems, how they work and how to
configure and use them; hopefully with a demonstration of each.

Adrian Woodley has been a Linux user for the past 8 years, both
professionally and as a hobby. He has worked on networks scaling from
small home setups through to Australia's largest ADSL2+ network. Adrian
currently works for iiNet as a Systems Engineer, and has 12 months
experience working in iiNet's Network Operations Centre, monitoring the
iiNet network. With this presentation, Adrian reaches the status of
PLUG's most prevalent presenter!

Daniel Axtens will talk about setting up Ubuntu to play MP3s, watch
YouTube videos, play Flash games, and maybe a couple of other useful
things to make your new Ubuntu system feel like home. Some points from
the talk will be applicable to users of other GNU/Linux distros. This is
a beginner-friendly talk.
