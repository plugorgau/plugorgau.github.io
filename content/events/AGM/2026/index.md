### Not-for-profit Self Review

The ATO introduced new rules requiring not for profits to declare why
they should be tax exempt, starting with the 2023-2024 financial year.

Harry began investigating the requirements in 2024.

Filing online required that the ATO trust that we could act on behalf
of PLUG.

Paperwork to add James as a public officer was accepted in
June 2025. New public officers can easily be added and removed now.

We are now up to date with our NFP self reviews.


### Venues

Our regular meetings at SpaceCubed relied on a SpaceCubed member to
act as sponsor.

We’ve had multiple people filling this role over the years, but lost
our most recent sponsor during 2025.

We have tried a few alternative venues since: Collins Street Centre in
South Perth, and UWA’s EZONE.

We will hopefully be cash flow positive in 2026, and able to spend
money on venues, but free is always preferred.
