Many large scale enterprise deployments include an automounter
implementation. The automounter provides a mechanism for automatically
mounting file systems upon access, and umounting them when they are no
longer referenced. It turns out that the Linux automounter is not
feature-complete. And there are cases where Linux is just plain
incompatible with the implementations from other proprietary vendors.

autofs deployments, and offers solutions to these problems.
