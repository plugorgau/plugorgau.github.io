If you couldn\'t make this year's linux.conf.au yourself, you can hear
all about what you missed out on - the best bits squeezed into 90
minutes of pure LCA recitals. If there were any topics on the [LCA
program](https://web.archive.org/web/20050312055050/http://linux.conf.au/program.php)
that you wished you could attend, come along and hear the essentials.
