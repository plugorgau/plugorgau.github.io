This talk will briefly describe the problem of revision control, and
explain some of the trade-offs in designing a trivial revision control
system and how just a few simple ideas can be combined to produce
something remarkably close to [GNU
Arch](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/).

After this, I'll describe some of the concerns in using Arch in
practice. A final section of the talk will mention other contenders in
the revision control world and the situations in which you might want
to use them instead.
