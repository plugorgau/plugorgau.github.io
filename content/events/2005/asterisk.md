Voice over IP has been around for several years but has only recently
reached a level suitable to replace traditional analogue phone systems.
Several standards have been produced for delivering VoIP. The current
standard for most VoIP systems is SIP. Like most other technologies on
the internet, Linux has its fair share of quality systems that provide
services for VoIP. Most notable of these is the Asterisk Software PABX.

This presentation will demonstrate the configuring of Asterisk and the
basic workings of SIP.

Adrian is a Network Engineer for Speek IP Phones, a VoIP Carrier.
