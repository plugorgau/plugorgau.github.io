Come and join us as PLUG celebrates the release of Ubuntu 18.04, the
latest long-term support release of the very popular Ubuntu Linux. We
will have a limited number of USB drives and DVDs with this latest
release of Ubuntu to give out at the event, which you can use to try
or even install Ubuntu. We'll also be showing off 18.04 on some
laptops if you just want to have a play.
