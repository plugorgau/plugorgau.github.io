Chromebooks Unleashed is a talk on the surprising potential of a cheap
Chromebook as a developer machine, as a toy and as a sandbox for
experimentation. Learn about Crouton, the Chromium OS Universal Chroot
Environment, and GalliumOS, a Linux distribution built specifically
for Chromebooks. The talk is complete with two live demos, one of
which might work. Join the excitement and enjoy the suspense!
