iVEC has a team entering the Student Cluster Competition at SC13 in
the US later this year. This is the pre-eminent event in the High
Performance Computing (HPC) world and it's great for Australia, and in
particular Western Australia to be involved thanks to iVEC and their
sponsors.

The team gave a presentation at PLUG going through the ins and outs of
super computing, the state of super compuing in WA, and information
about the competition itself.
