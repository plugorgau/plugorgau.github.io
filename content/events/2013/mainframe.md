For 8 months in 2007, I was part of a multi-national team working
towards winning a multi-million dollar contract to modernize the core
application of a very large logistics management company. According to
our client, at time of evaluation, our Linux on IBM Mainframe solution
was most innovative and bold.<!--more--> While we were able to
demonstrate meeting and exceeding all functional and non-functional
requirements in a live environment, we lost... This is my side of the

Thank you.
