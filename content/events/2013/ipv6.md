Following the success of 2012's World IPv6 Launch, several popular
websites and services are now available via IPv6. Participating sites
include Google, Facebook, Youtube, Yahoo and Wikipedia. In addition to
this newly accessible content, local ISPs are starting to investigate
supporting IPv6 for domestic consumers.

Adrian will present several ways for you to access the IPv6 Internet
today, using whichever Internet connection you currently have, as well
as common problems and gotchas. Following this presentation, there
should be no excuse for any of you not to be rolling out 'v6 at home.
