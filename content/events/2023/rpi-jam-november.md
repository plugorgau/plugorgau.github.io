With the launch of the new Raspberry Pi 5, we are hosting an event to
celebrate our favourite SBC single-board computer. We will be going
over the new features on Raspberry Pi 5.
<!--more-->

* Do you think Raspberry Pi's are interesting, but need help getting started
* Perhaps you want to make a low powered media server, or retro gaming machine.
* Do you have a Raspberry Pi project that you would like to show to others?
* Bring your own Laptop, Pi (if you have one) & power supply. We will have power boards to plug into, along with a monitor...
* There will be an opportunity to learn more about the new Raspberry PI 5, the Pi Global Shutter camera, and much more.

The evening will be mostly informal, but there will be an opportunity
for lightning talks, so if you would like to give a short presentation
about your Raspberry Pi Project, please let the committee know by
email.
