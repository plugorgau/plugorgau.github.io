We really appreciate people supporting PLUG by becoming a financial Member. Membership fees allow us to fund meetings, inter-state and international guest speakers, and other activities in support of Linux and Free & Open Source Software (FOSS). By becoming a Member you also earn the right to vote at our Annual General Meeting. Plus a whole swag of other [events](/events/_index.md) we run throughout the year.

## Membership

Membership costs are $50 per year, or $20 per year for students/concession.

To join PLUG as a new Member, please complete the [signup form](https://www.plug.org.au/ugmm/signup) and make a payment (see below).

Existing or past members can login to the [Membership section](https://www.plug.org.au/ugmm/) to update contact details and check your membership status. If you have forgotten your password, use your email address to [reset your password](https://www.plug.org.au/ugmm/resetpassword).

## Donations

PLUG welcomes donations for the same reasons as becoming a Member: to support its activities! As a registered non-profit association you can be assured any financial donations stay within PLUG to benefit members and the community at large. One of the best ways to help is by donating your time to help or lead activities. We also need hardware from time to time depending on the projects being run.
