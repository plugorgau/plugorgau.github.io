  <article class="post-content"><p>Once upon a time, Debian was a GNU/Linux distribution that was mainly
for hobbyists.  It always existed in the shadow of commercial
distributions such as Red Hat, and their derivatives.  Then Canonical
used it to create Ubuntu, and the world changed.  (In the interim
though, there were a lot of businesses relying on Debian as a stable,
low-TCO server OS with good security support.)</p>
<p>If you are running Debian on a personal host or in production, you
might have wondered how Debian packages work and whether you have a
use case for which they could make your life simpler.  This talk will
attempt to shed light on these questions.</p>
<p>Topics covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>.deb package format</li>
<li>Source Packages</li>
<li>Creating .deb files</li>
</ul>
<p>It is even possible to host your own package archive on an HTTP or FTP
server, with secure downloads provided by Debian&rsquo;s package signing
mechanism.</p>
<p>Please note that this talk will <em>not</em> cover becoming a Debian
maintainer/developer, which is usually what is required to upload
new/changed packages to the official Debian package archives.</p>
