<p>Secretary’s Report from Paul Del.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our paid membership was higher in the last half of 2018.</li>
<li>The previous committee had a few new ideas for events they starting testing in the last half of last year. That’s one thing to focus on for the 2019 committee.</li>
<li>I believe if we do any projects for 2019 we should be able to get grant sponsorship from Linux Australia <a href="http://linux.org.au">http://linux.org.au</a></li>
