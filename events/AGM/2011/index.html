Harry NcNally commented that with 340 mailing list members versus
financial members that it might be useful to ensure that electronic
membership renewal is fully setup and call for renewals via the list.

Daniel Beard suggested a subtle indicator of membership status in
mailing list posts.

Alastair suggested easy to add automatic footer with news info.

Nick noted the presence of a new club website utilizing Drupal.

Alastair noted the need to refine a list of membership benefits and
place it on the website, eg: list those working on open source projects.

James called for any ideas to be sent to the committee.
	Nick: events of note, particularly speakers
	James: especially friends, overseas visitors

Harry noted the absence of workshops and asked about feasibility.

Daniel Harmsworth said that the Artifactory can offer us of its large
working space in Osborne Park (Guthrie St). He gave a brief overview
of what the Artifactory is and the facilities it has. And offered to
act as liason for PLUG.

It was noted that there should be a vote of thanks to CCGS for the
use of their space, and that a letter should be sent.

It was also suggested that the Artifactory could serve as a venue
for an Installfest.
