      <description>&lt;p&gt;Online services like &amp;ldquo;If This Then That&amp;rdquo; (IFTTT) are great for
automating your life. However they provide few ways for the end-user
to add their own services, and not everyone is comfortable with
sharing their credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be discussing the &amp;rsquo;exobrain&amp;rsquo; project, which allows for service
integration and extension on a machine &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; control. We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss
philosophy, installation, and writing your own extensions and
classifiers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
