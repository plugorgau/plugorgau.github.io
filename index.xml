      <title>March Talk: Deploying IoT/embedded applications with Ubuntu Core by James Henstridge</title>
      <link>http://www.plug.org.au/events/2019/iot-ubuntu/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Small single board computers like the Raspberry Pi provide a great
base for deploying projects. However, designing a system so it can be
updated after deployment can be a challenge. When devices are hooked
up to the Internet, this becomes even more critical due to the regular
stream of security vulnerabilities that may impact the install.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>October Talk: Creating Deb Packages by Alastair Irvine</title>
      <link>http://www.plug.org.au/events/2018/creating-deb-packages/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2018 18:00:00 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.plug.org.au/events/2018/creating-deb-packages/</guid>
      <description>Once upon a time, Debian was a GNU/Linux distribution that was mainly for hobbyists. It always existed in the shadow of commercial distributions such as Red Hat, and their derivatives. Then Canonical used it to create Ubuntu, and the world changed. (In the interim though, there were a lot of businesses relying on Debian as a stable, low-TCO server OS with good security support.)
If you are running Debian on a personal host or in production, you might have wondered how Debian packages work and whether you have a use case for which they could make your life simpler.</description>

      <title>April Talk: Confined applications on the desktop by James Henstridge</title>
      <link>http://www.plug.org.au/events/2018/desktop-snaps/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 18:00:00 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.plug.org.au/events/2018/desktop-snaps/</guid>
      <description>Traditionally, Linux distributions have relied on package archives maintained by groups of trusted maintainers. While this works well, users often end up looking to third party sources for newer versions or software missing from the main archive. This can reduce the security of a system, since traditional packaging systems place a lot of trust in the package maintainers (e.g. running scripts as root during package installation).
This talk will look at the snapd packaging system, which is inspired by the confinement strategies used for smart phone applications.</description>

      <description>PLUG is looking for a new Logo.
We have entries so far from Peter Taekema (Great Southern Computer Services-http://gscomputers.com.au ) and Jason Nicholls. Both have earned themselves a year&amp;rsquo;s membership to PLUG (which is worth double as of 1 July 2011!).
One of the desired features of our new logo is to have it in SVG (vector) format if possible, so if anyone wants to have a play with any of the submitted entries (or indeed a fresh entry) then you will still be eligible for the free membership (or renewal).</description>

      <description>The PLUG mailing list is one of the main points of interaction between PLUG members. (Another being our regular meetings and events.) The list is for discussion of everything Linux-related and can be a good way to get help for those having trouble with Linux. Off-topic messages are tolerated in small quantities but longer threads should be moved to the off-topic list. We don&amp;rsquo;t look fondly upon flaming, trolling or spamming.</description>

      <description>This procedure is to take you from packed up boxes to a live stream. Follow all the steps, none of them are optional unless marked.
Step 1 - DV Switch &amp;amp; Streaming Get the main system up and running first and get a stream happening with our pre-recorded PLUG loop. With multiple people helping out then have someone take care of this while the others can get on with Step 2 in parallel.</description>

      <title>Video Streaming: Architectural Overview</title>
      <link>http://www.plug.org.au/projects/video/overview/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.plug.org.au/projects/video/overview/</guid>
      <description>The goal is to produce a stream of video, with vision and audio mixed in real time, consisting of at least one camera pointed at a presenter, and a recording of their screen while they present, streamed in real-time to at least one internet-hosted location where it is viewable by outside viewers.
The project consists of three &amp;ldquo;layers&amp;rdquo;:
The network hardware, a simple router which consumes WiFi, Ethernet or 4G/5G at a location and provides it to AV equipment (&amp;ldquo;PLUG-Members&amp;rdquo; WiFi network) and, optionally, PLUG guests (&amp;ldquo;PLUG&amp;rdquo; WiFi network) The AV equipment, consisting of a laptop (whether PLUG-provided, or presenter-provided) with a webcam for capturing the presenter + HDMI output for presenting on a TV screen or projector at a venue.</description>

      <title>Video Streaming: Network setup</title>

      <description>Network hardware forms the backbone of the video streaming setup. The goal of it is to provide a simple solution for consuming an internet connection from whatever is available - WiFi, 4G/5G tethering or an Ethernet internet connection - and turning that connection into a consistent network for PLUG guests + AV hardware.
Introduction The network hardware currently consists of a GL.iNet GL-MT1300 &amp;ldquo;Beryl&amp;rdquo; WiFi router, running OpenWRT - referred to throughout the rest of this document as &amp;ldquo;Beryl&amp;rdquo;.</description>
