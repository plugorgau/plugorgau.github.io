  <article class="post-content"><p>The PLUG mailing list is one of the main points of interaction between PLUG members. (Another being our regular <a href="/events/">meetings and events</a>.) The list is for discussion of everything Linux-related and can be a good way to get help for those having trouble with Linux. Off-topic messages are tolerated in small quantities but longer threads should be moved to the <a href="#offtopic">off-topic list</a>. We don&rsquo;t look fondly upon <a href="https://foldoc.org/flame">flaming</a>, <a href="https://foldoc.org/troll">trolling</a> or <a href="https://foldoc.org/spam">spamming</a>. Announcements of PLUG events are posted to the <a href="#announce">plug-announce</a> list, which automagically includes subscribers of the PLUG list. Linux.conf.au Bid discussions take place in the <a href="#userconf">userconf</a> list, which automagically includes subscribers of the PLUG list. Some topics come up again and again. If you&rsquo;re new to the list you&rsquo;re encouraged to <a href="http://lists.plug.org.au/pipermail/">search the archives</a> (or look at recent postings) in case your questions have already been answered.</p>

<p>There is an <a href="http://lists.plug.org.au/pipermail/plug/">archive of all messages</a>. <small>Be aware when you post to any of the PLUG lists that they are <strong>publicly archived</strong> and that Google indexes our archives. Our policy is that PLUG archives will be not be edited unless there are legal reasons for doing so (e.g. posting copyrighted material).</small></p>
<h2 id="a-nameannouncethe-plug-announce-lista"><a name="announce">The plug-announce list</a></h2>
<p>The plug-announce list is a low-traffic moderated mailing list, used for announcing upcoming PLUG events. It averages around 3 or 4 messages per month. Subscribers of the main PLUG mailing list are automatically subscribed to the plug-announce list, so need not subscribe again. However, if you want to keep up with PLUG events, without the traffic from the main PLUG list, then subscribe to plug-announce. To subscribe, send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:plug-announce-request@plug.org.au">plug-announce-request@plug.org.au</a> containing the word <tt>subscribe</tt> in the subject or body of the message. To leave, send a message containing <tt>unsubscribe</tt> to the same address. You can also <a href="http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/plug-announce">subscribe or unsubscribe over the web</a>. There is also <a href="https://old.plug.org.au/archives/list/plug-announce.html">an archive</a> of all the past posts to the plug-announce list.</p>
<h2 id="a-namejobsthe-jobs-lista"><a name="jobs">The Jobs list</a></h2>
<p>We have a list for employment opportunities for those skilled in Linux and Open Source technologies - and of course for recruiters trying to find those people. Please keep descriptions clear, and do not post the same job more than once per month. You can <a href="http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/jobs/">subscribe or unsubscribe</a> over the web.</p>
<h2 id="a-nameadminthe-admin-lista"><a name="admin">The Admin list</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/admin">Admin subcommittee</a> - Running PLUG&rsquo;s own online infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-nameavthe-av-lista"><a name="av">The AV list</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/av">AV subcommittee</a> - Audio/Video recording project</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-nameofftopicthe-off-topic-lista"><a name="offtopic">The off-topic list</a></h2>
<p>We have a separate mailing list for PLUG members to use for discussions which are not necessarily of interest to the rest of PLUG. It can be a place to rant and rave, debate pedantic points of language, discuss non-Linux-related news or even argue about the merits of capitalism. Generally, conversations which drift too far from any relevance to Linux move to the off-topic list when people start complaining. To join it, send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:off-topic-request@plug.org.au">off-topic-request@plug.org.au</a> containing the word <tt>subscribe</tt> in the subject or body of the message. To leave, send a message containing <tt>unsubscribe</tt> to the same address. You can post to it by sending messages to <a href="mailto:off-topic@plug.org.au">off-topic@plug.org.au</a>. You can also <a href="http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/off-topic">subscribe or unsubscribe over the web</a>. There is also <a href="https://old.plug.org.au/archives/list/plug-off-topic.html">an archive</a> of all the past posts to the off-topic list.</p>
<h2 id="a-nameuserconfthe-userconf-lista"><a name="userconf">The userconf list</a></h2>
<p>We have a separate mailing list for PLUG members to use for discussions about the Linux.conf.au Bid. To join it, send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:userconf-request@plug.org.au">userconf-request@plug.org.au</a> containing the word <tt>subscribe</tt> in the subject or body of the message. To leave, send a message containing <tt>unsubscribe</tt> to the same address. You can post to it by sending messages to <a href="mailto:userconf@plug.org.au">userconf@plug.org.au</a>. You can also <a href="http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/userconf">subscribe or unsubscribe over the web</a>.</p>
