  * Quick shout out to the committee for a lot of work over 2018
  * Last year, we set some goals:
     * Have the new website online
     * Have our infrastructure in a long-term maintainable state
     * Have functional backups
     * Fully functional AV
  * We have achieved 2.5 of these goals. The new site is online, we have functional backups and our infrastructure is partially finished.
  * Big efforts to migrate to new AWS instances. Thanks Peter, Nick, Benjamin and others.
  * We will put a call for paid proposals to migrate to new server infrastructure
  * AV needs further work after the server admin is complete.

* Treasurer's Report from Peter Lyons.
  * Current assets: $3313.34
  * Alastair mentioned what about a long term savings account. Can the new committee please consider this for 2019.

* Secretary’s Report from Paul Del.
  * Our paid membership was higher in the last half of 2018.
  * The previous committee had a few new ideas for events they starting testing in the last half of last year. That’s one thing to focus on for the 2019 committee.
  * I believe if we do any projects for 2019 we should be able to get grant sponsorship from Linux Australia http://linux.org.au
